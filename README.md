JS-Widgets is series of small projects that work on implementing popular design elements in real projects that confuse me when I encounter the first time

# Accordion definition

Accordion UI Components are designs that mimic the physical movement and appearance of a physical accordion (instrument), which expands and collapses to produce music. Accordion in UI design collapses to hide the content, and expands to reveal it. 

# Why I care

I realize a lot Q&A section implements this design. Also, there may be other similar use cases that also adopts this practice

# Popular use cases

- Q&A section that gives a list of questions. Once we click directly on the question or a button beside it, the answer reveals itself under the question.
- When we surf Linkedin, Instagram, or Tweeter, most statuses are written in paragraphs that would be time-consuming to skip the content we do not like to see. Instead, most of the time, we can see the title and around 20 first words of the status, ending with "See more". Once we click on it, the content appears, but this time, it ends with "See less"

# Features

## Reveal content:

Click on the plus icon beside the question

## Hide content

Click on the minus sign beside the question (when the answer appears)

# Deploy

I use Vercel to deploy this simple web app

This project is inspired by [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/tree/master/06-modal). My starter code is based on his code in the repo.
